## Contribution checklist

Before contributing, I, the opener of this request:

-   [ ] Agree to use the same license of each modified file;
-   [ ] Have followed the [contribution guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTE.md);
-   [ ] Have tested it locally;
-   [ ] Have committed locally and not through a git hosting service such as
    GitHub Web; and
-   [ ] Have reviewed and updated any documentation if relevant.

Lacking to check any of the above can result in the rejection of the
contribution without no further comment.

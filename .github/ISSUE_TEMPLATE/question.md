### Commitment

I confirm that I have read the following resources:

*   [How to troubleshoot Qusal](https://github.com/ben-grande/qusal/blob/main/docs/TROUBLESHOOT.md)
*   [How to ask questions The Smart Way](http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
*   [Writing the perfect question](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/)
*   [Question checklist](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2012/11/24/stack-overflow-question-checklist/)
*   [Could you please make my preference the default?](https://www.qubes-os.org/faq/#could-you-please-make-my-preference-the-default)

<!--
If it doesn't affect a large user base, you will have more chance to get our
attention by contributing to the project either helping on support, code or
money contribution than trying to deeply justify why you preferences should be
the default.

If you haven't read at least two of the aforementioned resources, there is a
good chance your text will not be well written and therefore considered
invalid.

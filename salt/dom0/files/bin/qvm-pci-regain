##
## After attaching a PCI device and detaching it, the device is not available
## in Dom0 anymore. This is an intended feature. A device which was previously
## assigned to a less trusted qube could attack dom0 if it were automatically
## reassigned there. In order to re-enable the device in dom0, either reboot
## physical machine or run the following script.
##
## This is useful for testing purposes when testing PCI devices, not
## recommended for users to attach a device to Dom0.
